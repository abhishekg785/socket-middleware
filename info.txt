what i learnt:

socket.io uses middleware
eg:
io.use(function(socket,next){
	console.log('middleware');
});

we have authorization middleware  ,but is depreciated in the latest release
=> so this is executed every time a new connection is made
io.set('authorization',function(handshake,callback){
	callback(null,true);   //two parameterers :first is the error reason and the second one is true of false
});
